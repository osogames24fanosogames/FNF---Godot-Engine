# FNF - Godot Engine
(NOT DONE! I'M STILL TESTING AND PUTTING FEATURES IN BEFORE A STABLE RELEASE!)

# Warning: The engine is moving from Godot 3.3.stable.offical to Godot 3.3.4.stable.mono.offical, or in short terms, Godot Universal 3.3 to Godot Mono 3.3.4. This means a few things. 1, if you wanna keep fixing bugs, you gotta update (unless you already have Mono 3.3.4). and 2, This engine can finally support C#. If you don't have the version, the Godot website is https://godotengine.org/. Again, C# will finally be supported and in order to continue fixing bugs, you may need to update your engine. Thanks for reading.

Welcome to the github page (or source code) of FNF - Godot Engine! You know how normal/vanilla FNF and it's other engines mainly run on HaxeFlixel or .hx files for the source files? Well, this engine uses the Godot Engine to make stuff, edit stuff, make charts, etc. 

Want to suggest features or send bug fixes for me to fix? Send an email to osogames24@gmail.com.

Notes:

- This project is still in it's VERY early stages. Don't expect much right now.
- If you wanna make mods once we release a stable version, just wait until we add the building.md file.
- This was made in Godot 3.3.stable.offical, so versions of Godot before 3.3 might have trouble getting the project to work.

That's all folks! :D
