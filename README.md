# FNF - Godot Engine
(NOT DONE! I'M STILL TESTING AND PUTTING FEATURES IN BEFORE A STABLE RELEASE!)

Welcome to the github page (or source code) of FNF - Godot Engine! You know how normal/vanilla FNF and it's other engines mainly run on HaxeFlixel or .hx files for the source files? Well, this engine uses the Godot Engine to make stuff, edit stuff, make charts, etc. 

Want to suggest features or send bug fixes for me to fix? Send an email to osogames24@gmail.com.

Notes:

- This project is still in it's VERY early stages. Don't expect much right now.
- If you wanna make mods once we release a stable version, just wait until we add the building.md file.
- The latest version was made in Godot 3.3.4.stable.mono.offical, so versions of Godot before 3.3.4 (Mono Version w/ C# support) might have trouble getting the project to work.

That's all folks! :D
